# Unofficial Code::Blocks repo

seems <https://github.com/oliliango/codeblocks> and <https://github.com/obfuscated/codeblocks_sf> are both unmaintained now, so I created this.

## original readme

This is the Code::Blocks IDE version 20.03
For license info, see the file "COPYING"
For compilers info, see the file "COMPILERS"
For support/feedback visit http://www.codeblocks.org
